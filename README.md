# React Email Creator

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/mCodex/react-email-creator.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This project aims to help people creating HTML that can be sent by email. Actually, I didn't code the editor itself, but I just wrapped it in a `create-react-app` project and implemented a few methods.
